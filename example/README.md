#### That's basic example that changes LED lights connected on PC3 and PC0 based on input from PC1. You can analyse this to get better understanding of library. Library is simillar to Arduino library so you should't have hard time understanding it.
Also feel free to copy "init.c", "linker_conf.ld" and "mk" file, that what is needed to setup 
STM and get it working. Without it, microcontroller propably doesn`t even start!
